    ### Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (furlough scheme)

    If you've had to ask your employees to stop working or work less because of coronavirus (put them on 'furlough') you can get support to pay their wages for the hours they do not work. The scheme has been extended until the end of September 2021.

    The government will pay:

    - 80% of employees’ usual wages for hours they do not work, up to a maximum of £2,500 per month, until the end of June
    - 70% of employees' usual wages for hours they do not work, up to a maximum of £2187.50 per month, until the end of July
    - 60% of employees' usual wages for hours they do not work, up to a maximum of £1875 per month, until the end of August and September

    The employees must receive 80% of their usual wages up to a maximum of £2500 per month until the end of September 2021.
    From July 2021 to September 2021, you will have to make up the difference between the government payment and what the employee should receive.


    You must submit your claims by 11.59pm 14 calendar days after the month you’re claiming for. If this time falls on the weekend or a bank holiday then claims should be submitted on the next working day.
    For example you must submit your claim by:

    - 14 April 2021, for eligible employees on furlough in March 2021
    - 14 May 2021, for eligible employees on furlough in April 2021

  The new scheme lets you pay your deferred VAT in equal instalments, interest free. You can spread your payments across 2 to 11 monthly instalments, including your first payment, depending on when you join. The earlier you join, the more months you have to spread your payments across.

  - 19 March 2021, you can pay in 11 instalments
  - 21 April 2021, you can pay in 10 instalments
  - 19 May 2021, you can pay in 9 instalments
  - 21 June 2021, you can pay in 8 instalments

  You must opt into the VAT deferral new payment scheme by 21 June 2021.

  If you’re on the VAT Annual Accounting Scheme or the VAT Payment on Account Scheme, you can join the scheme from 10 March 2021.
