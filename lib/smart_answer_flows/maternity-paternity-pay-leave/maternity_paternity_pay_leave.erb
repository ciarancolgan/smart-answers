  You’ll need:

  * your baby’s due date
  * your [employment status](/employment-status), for example 'employee' or 'worker'

  For each current or recent job you have before having a baby, you'll need:

  * the job’s start date
  * how much you earned
  * the job’s end date (if it has ended)

  You might need to give information about more than one job.

  You’ll need the same information about your partner if you’ll care for the child with them.

  ^You might also be able to get [Shared Parental Leave and Pay](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay).
